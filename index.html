<h2 style="font-size:26px;color:Yellow;font-:arial;">MY INTEREST IN IT</h2>

  

 
<p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">My interest in IT started when I was about 7 years old. I wanted a computer so badly. At the time I didn’t know what a computer consists of I thought it was made of complex parts that I wouldn’t understand. I use to go on the streets and find broken parts of pcs. I collected a lot of pc parts and try put them together. Needless to say, 80% of the time there would catch fire or wouldn’t turn on. Until one day I collected all the right parts and it powered up. I was faced with the OS not booting. I went to the library found a way to burn a windows on to a cd. That where it all started I use to like helping people repair there hard drive though MS dos . I started to learn how to build websites from notepad. I pick RMIT because its well known and has a reputation for high standard.

This role is deep in application base programs .Creating applications to improve designs for hardware .To collect data and find solutions to problems that arise when creating something new. To also be in charge of negotiating what would be best for the project we are on. There a lot more I don’t understand about the role but hoping this it role will fill in the gaps. I’m passionate in helping others and solving problems in whatever situation. For this position I would have to have 10 years in the field. Everything from programing and leadership would will get me into the right direction. To help and to know how to push co worker including me to the next level.

  <h5 style="font-size:27px;color:Yellow;font-arial;">What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h5>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">I believe they can help see things you couldn’t see before. It helps to see your strengths.

  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">They influence me to work on somethings the I’m not partially good at so I can be a strong leader for my team . It also encourages me  to spread what influence me to my fellow peers 
  
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">To design a Desk for confine spaces. The Desk will made easy to roll around and simple to use . The desk would be able to hold a desktop computer and monitor. With a press of a button its will hide the computer and desktop in the table. The customer will be able to use it as a table. The product will be able to move around on soft or hard surfaces .The customer will be able to use there app to close or open it.They can also put a timer on it so in certain parts of the day it will convert .Its important as computers are already taking the most of our time . The only obstacles we face is getting people to realize this could be a big change to the world in a small way . </p>


<p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">This will be useful all around the in some parts of Australia and the world. According to census data, the number of studio apartments in Australia increased 15 per cent from 2006 to 2011, increasing by 5,000 units to 37,600. In central Melbourne and Footscray, studio apartments for sale are as small as 15 square meters. Although making new bigger development  would help . Making smart appliances could help small spaces feel bigger keeping cost down and giving more space . We have all the tech to build future. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">The desk/table will be dimensions: 105 x 50 x 75cm.The desk will feature a 5-socket power strip in the unit. This will allow us to plug everything in the unit. You will just use one plug to plug into the wall. The unit will also feature wheels inside the legs on the table. We will use Hydraulics to lift the wheels up so it easy to push when needed. The wheels will have springs to better support any surfaces in may face. The Table also features balsa wood which only weights 7.5 a cube foot. The table would be super light. The table will support a 1080p 22” monitor that will slip in and out The table will have Wi-Fi enable .It will also have a chip to check power consumption . To also Program when or what times the table should convert. This will be ideal to students where they a book a certain time when they need the desk. The desk will hand students request and best help times are available. The desk will automatedly login and turn on the time it recommended you to get on. For non-students it will help better manage their times. If you have lunch at 12:00 most days and work home at 6am to 3pm. The table will convert for you. If want to spend only 2 hours on the computer you can set up to do that from the app.Though out the week you can see how much time you spend on your computer. You also be able to check power usage from the app. You can see if there better always to help save power. You would be able to get on a train forgot you left your pc on just jump on the app and you be able to shut power off. This would greatly help our time management. Office workers spend 1,700 hours a year in front of a computer screen. The avg American spends about 11 hours on a screen. To combat this we can limit ourselves when we are at home. The program would have to be secured. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">Skills required for such project will need a team. We would need project manger , network engineer , computer installation , Architect and software development.. The Architect needs to developed the best possible and way to build a sleek table . The software would be a big collaborative project that need program with the hardware. Also a desktop app to login the computer and also a phone app.I believe we will need to use software like cab to design. We would need to create a program from scratch using phylon or java  . The chip we could use is raspberry pie. We would need network engineer to make sure everything on the network is secure. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 6px 500px;font-size:18px;font-arial;">If the project is successful, we wouldn’t have to keep building more developments. We would make more smart Furniture  .We would better our times in our lives. At first it would be expensive but will later save money .It will also help us be with our family more .The outcome will lead more innovated projects to better help out everyday life. This would be one of those small things the could effect in a big way as years goes by
