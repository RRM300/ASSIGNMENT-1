<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin:5px 500px 5px 500px;font-size:16px;font-family:arial;"> My interest in IT started when I was about 7 years old. I wanted a computer so badly. At the time I didn’t know what a computer consists of I thought it was made of complex parts that I wouldn’t understand. I use to go on the streets and find broken parts of pcs. I collected a lot of pc parts and try put them together. Needless to say, 80% of the time there would catch fire or wouldn’t turn on. Until one day I collected all the right parts and it powered up. I was faced with the OS not booting. I went to the library found a way to burn a windows on to a cd. That where it all started I use to like helping people repair there hard drive though MS dos . I started to learn how to build websites from notepad. I pick RMIT because its well known and has a reputation for high standard.
